We explored how OA navigate VR environments and what perception they have about VR (with how to differ from young adults). As a result, we suggested the design opportunities for VR as an educational material for disaster evacuation.\n\n As the first author, I led research and participated in all parts of the study other than VR development.",

So, we propose an AI-based food record & freshness evaluation app for the OA. A LiDAR sensor was used to measure the volume of food, allowing for more accurate nutrient analysis. \n\nI led the project and developed an iPad app and a volume estimation using a LiDAR sensor.",
