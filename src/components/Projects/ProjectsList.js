        description: "We proposed VR content for fire evacuation training for the older adults (OA). We explored how OA navigate educational VR environments and what perception they have about VR. Moreover, we found how OA's behavior and perception differ from young adults. As a result, VR can be usefully used as an educational material for disaster evacuation training for the OA.\n\n As the first author, I led research and participated in all parts of the study other than VR content development.",

To solve this problem, we developed a pill search application using a hierarchical image classification model for 2500 Korean pills. \n\nI was responsible for developing cross-platform applications based on Flutter.",

We propose an AI-based food record & freshness evaluation app for the OA. A LiDAR sensor was used to measure the volume of food, allowing for more accurate nutrient analysis. \n\nI led the project and developed an iPad application and a volume measurement function using a LiDAR sensor.",

Of course, there were online learning platforms like internet lectures in the past, but no one would have imagined that all kinds of classes would be conducted non-face-to-face like now. Our team developed Surf, an remote learning solution that can help reducing the gap between teachers and students during non-face-to-face class. \n\nI was responsible for developing web services based on React and SCSS.",

Based on semi-structured interviews with 14 participants, we identified SVI's motivations for live streaming, their unique interactions with videos and people on live streaming platforms, and the challenges they face during live streaming. Based on the results of this study, we present design opportunities to better support SVI on live streaming platforms. \n\nIn this study, I analyzed the interview results using an affinity diagram, and designed design opportunities.",

We developed a rule-based chatbot application (CSO, a C2C marketplace sales assistant for OA) to help the OA and asked OA's opinions. We expect the OA to be able to actively participate in the market as sellers of goods rather than as buyers. \n\nThis research is a Mercari R4D internship project, and I led the project and developed iOS application.",
